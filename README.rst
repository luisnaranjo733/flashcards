Flashcards
==========

Flashcards is a simple memorization tool, written in **python**, which aims to emulate real flashcards.

The user can add “decks” of flashcards for different types of subjects, which are stored in a sqlite3 database. 

The user can then quiz his or herself using the Leitner Algorithm, which focuses card repetition based on the most commonly missed cards.

More information on the Leitner Algorithm here: http://flashcarddb.com/leitner

**Flashcards is under active development.**

Source is up on github: http://github.com/doubledubba/flashcards.git

It has recently been revived (5/5/12)

Here is the old version: https://launchpad.net/pyflashcards

The older version was written messily, with manual SQL expressions, and the sqlite3 module.

This one will be a lot cleaner, and will depend on SQLAlchemy (0.7.7)
