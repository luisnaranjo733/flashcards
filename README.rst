Flashcards
==========

A , similar to physical flash card quizzing.

Flashcards is a simple memorization tool, written in **python**, which aims to emulate real flashcards.

The user can add “bundles” of flashcards for different types of subjects, which are stored in a sqlite3 database. 

The user can then quiz his or herself using the Leitner Algorithm, which focuses card repetition based on the most commonly missed cards.

**Flashcards is under active development.**

It has recently been revived (5/5/12)

Here is the old version: https://launchpad.net/pyflashcards

The older version was written messily, with manual SQL expressions, and the sqlite3 module.

This one will be a lot cleaner, and will depend on SQLAlchemy (0.7.7)
