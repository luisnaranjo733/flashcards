Welcome to Flashcards's documentation!
======================================

A simple memorization tool, written in **python**, similar to physical flash
card quizzing.

**Flashcards is under active development.**

Source is on github: http://github.com/doubledubba/flashcards.git
It has recently been revived (5/5/12)

Here is the old version: https://launchpad.net/pyflashcards

The older version was written messily, with manual SQL expressions.

This one will be a lot cleaner, and will depend on SQLAlchemy (0.7.7)
